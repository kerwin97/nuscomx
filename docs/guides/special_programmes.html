will require approximately 230 to 240 MCs in total, while a DDP in Computer Science and
Mathematics will require less as there are more modules that overlap. Look at both your
degree requirements, eliminate the overlap, and count all the unique modules that are
required &mdash; this will be the total modules you need to take.</p><h2>What is the workload like for a DDP student?</h2><p>This depends on the total number of modules you need to take, your capability, and your
other commitments. It is flexible. The norm is for students to take 6 modules per semester
and graduate in 5 years. However, you have the flexibility to take 7 or even 8 modules and
graduate in 4 years or choose a slower pace and take a longer time to graduate.</p><h2>How long will it take to complete a DDP?</h2><p>The typical duration is 5 years. It could be less or more, depending how fast the individual
clears his/her modules.</p><h2>Can I still do a DDP halfway during my studies?</h2><p>Yes, you may still apply a DDP after your first year of studies. Do strive for good grades
in your first 2 semesters if you are aiming to do so.</p><h2>Is there any minimum requirement to continue my DDP?</h2><p>Yes, you will need to maintain a minimum CAP of 3.75 for your primary degree and a minimum
CAP of 3.25 for your secondary degree to continue. Else, you will be asked to drop your
secondary degree.</p><h2>What is the difference between a primary and secondary degree?</h2><p>Your primary degree is the degree from your home faculty. If you continue the DDP until
graduation, there is absolutely no difference &mdash; you get a separate degree certificate
for each degree. However, if you choose to drop one degree, you may only drop your secondary
degree. You are encouraged to take more modules from your primary degree in the first year
so that in the event you drop your secondary degree, you will not be lagging too far behind
your peers in your primary degree.</p><h2>What is the difference between my home faculty and secondary faculty?</h2><p>There is virtually no difference other than the fact that you pay the school fees of your
home faculty, and that some faculties might not allow students who has another separate home
faculty to apply for SEP through that faculty. Otherwise, you are still a student of both
faculties. You are eligible for dean's list and awards from both faculties.</p><h2>How is my CAP computed as a DDP student?</h2><p>Since you will be awarded 2 separate degrees upon graduation, you will have 2 separate CAPs
computed.</p><h2>What happens if I drop my DDP?</h2><p>You may only drop your secondary degree. If you wish to drop your primary degree, you will
first have to apply to change faculty (subject to approval) before dropping your secondary
degree post faculty change. Your both CAPs will then be combined into 1.</p><h2>Can I still go for SEP as a DDP student?</h2><p>Yes, you may go for SEP through your home faculty. Going for SEP through your secondary
faculty depends on whether your secondary faculty allows for that. Depending on the number
of modules you manage to map in SEP, you might or might not need to extend your candidature.
If you are planning to go for SEP, it might be good to plan which modules are easily mapped
and refrain from taking them in NUS.</p><h2>Can I still go for NOC as a DDP student?</h2><p>Yes, you may go for either the 6-months or 1-year NOC. NOC is a programme where you work and
study overseas. However, the modules you take during NOC are typically entrepreneurship
modules and do not count towards either degree requirements. Hence, it is like you will have
to extend your candidature or take even more modules in your other semesters should you
decide to go for NOC.</p></div></div></main><footer><div class="social-links"><div class="social-link"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nuscomputing"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a><p class="tooltip">Facebook</p></div><div class="social-link"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/NUSComputingClub"><i class="fab fa-instagram"></i></a><p class="tooltip">Instagram</p></div><div class="social-link"><a href="https://t.me/nuscomputingclub"><i class="fab fa-telegram"></i></a><p class="tooltip">Telegram</p></div><div class="social-link"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVd-qsSFF328UUqcNxudy0w"><i class="fab fa-youtube"></i></a><p class="tooltip">YouTube</p></div><div class="social-link"><a href="https://github.com/NUSComputingDev"><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a><p class="tooltip">Github</p></div><div class="social-link"><a href="mailto:connect@nuscomputing.com"><i class="fas fa-envelope"></i></a><p class="tooltip">Email</p></div></div><div class="citation"><p>Copyright &copy; NUS Students' Computing Club</p><p>Page designed by <a href="https://github.com/nexolute">Eugene Lim</a></p><p><a href="https://nuscomputing.com/privacy.html">Privacy Statement</a></p></div></footer></body></html>
