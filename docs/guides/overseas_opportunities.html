company and take entrepreneurship modules at the same time. The selection process consist of
3 rounds of interview, but you may proceed straight to the second round if you completed at
least a Project Gemini for Orbital (Year 1 summer project, information will be make known to
you in due time). While a good CAP will be beneficial, it does not play as heavy a weightage
as your interview or portfolio.</p><p>Find out more about NUS Overseas Colleges

another overseas/local partner University for 1 Semester. If you are able to map the modules
you took in the partner University, it will be considered as you have fulfilled the module
that you mapped onto. If you are planning to go for SEP, it might be good to plan which
modules are easily mapped and refrain from taking them in NUS. Modules taken and mapped will
only be graded on a pass-fail basis and will not affect your CAP. You may find out all
available pre-approved modules
<a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/beyond/sep/sepnoc-public" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>In the SEP selection process, your CAP plays a vital role. So, if youâ€™re aiming to go SEP
through computing, it will be good to strive for a good CAP. That said, with the newly
implemented SoC Student Award System (last tab of guides), participating in various other
student life events also entitles you to different tiers of this award, which in turns
boosts your SEP chances. You will be informed through email when calls for application for
SEP starts.</p><p>Find out more about Student Exchange Programmes
